By that time Adidas\\'s football boots were considerably lighter than the ones made before the war, based on English designs. At the World Cup Adi had a secret weapon, which he revealed when West Germany made the finals against the overwhelmingly favored Hungarian team, which was undefeated since May 1950 and had defeated West Germany 8–3 in group play. Despite this defeat, West Germany made the knock-out rounds by twice defeating Turkey handily. The team defeated Yugoslavia and Austria to reach the final (a remarkable achievement), where the hope of many German fans was simply that the team \"avoid another humiliating defeat\" at the hands of the Hungarians. The day of the final began with light rain, which brightened the prospects of the West German team who called it \"\"Fritz Walter-Wetter\"\" because the team\\'s best player excelled in muddy conditions. Dassler informed Herberger before the match of his latest innovation—\"screw in studs.\" Unlike the traditional boot which had fixed leather spike studs, Dassler\\'s shoe allowed spikes of various lengths to be affixed depending on the state of the pitch. As the playing field at Wankdorf Stadium drastically deteriorated, Herberger famously announced, \"Adi, screw them on.\" The longer spikes improved the footing of West German players compared to the Hungarians whose mud-caked boots were also much heavier. The West Germans staged a come from behind upset, winning 3-2, in what became known as the \"Miracle in Bern.\" Herberger publicly praised Dassler as a key contributor to the win, and Adidas\\'s fame rose both in West Germany, where the win was considered a key post-war event in restoring German self-esteem and abroad, where in the first televised World Cup final viewers were introduced to \"the ultimate breakthrough.\"', 'title': 'Adolf Dassler', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2373164'}]\n"

Almost immediately after the incident, the FCC received a flood of complaints from parents who just wanted their children to enjoy a nice, wholesome three hours of grown men inflicting damaging and long-lasting pain on each other for sport. Halftime shows would never be the same.\" Patrick Gipson of \"Bleacher Report\" ranked it as #1 in its list of the most \"Jaw Dropping Moments of the Last Decade\", stating Janet \"changed the landscape of live television forever\". Gipson explained \"It prompted a million mothers to cover their eyes, fathers and sons to jump out of their seats in shock and numerous sanctions by the Federal Communications Commission, including a US$550,000 fine against CBS. Talk about a halftime show that will be hard to top.\" The incident was also declared \"the most memorable Super Bowl halftime show in history\", as well as \"the most controversial\", adding \"you can't talk about this halftime show, or any subsequent halftime show from here to eternity, without mentioning the wardrobe malfunction\".\n",

      "text: West Germany (established in May 1949) was not eligible for the 1950 World Cup (the first after the war), and so all preparations were made with a view toward the 1954 matches in Bern, Switzerland. By that time Adidas's football boots were considerably lighter than the ones made before the war, based on English designs. At the World Cup Adi had a secret weapon, which he revealed when West Germany made the finals against the overwhelmingly favored Hungarian team, which was undefeated since May 1950 and had defeated West Germany 8–3 in group play. Despite this defeat, West Germany made the knock-out rounds by twice defeating Turkey handily. The team defeated Yugoslavia and Austria to reach the final (a remarkable achievement), where the hope of many German fans was simply that the team \"avoid another humiliating defeat\" at the hands of the Hungarians. The day of the final began with light rain, which brightened the prospects of the West German team who called it \"\"Fritz Walter-Wetter\"\" because the team's best player excelled in muddy conditions. Dassler informed Herberger before the match of his latest innovation—\"screw in studs.\" Unlike the traditional boot which had fixed leather spike studs, Dassler's shoe allowed spikes of various lengths to be affixed depending on the state of the pitch. As the playing field at Wankdorf Stadium drastically deteriorated, Herberger famously announced, \"Adi, screw them on.\" The longer spikes improved the footing of West German players compared to the Hungarians whose mud-caked boots were also much heavier. The West Germans staged a come from behind upset, winning 3-2, in what became known as the \"Miracle in Bern.\" Herberger publicly praised Dassler as a key contributor to the win, and Adidas's fame rose both in West Germany, where the win was considered a key post-war event in restoring German self-esteem and abroad, where in the first televised World Cup final viewers were introduced to \"the ultimate breakthrough.\"\n",

      "text: Der Begriff Strukturalismus ist vom Wort Struktur abgeleitet und wurde vereinzelt seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts verwendet. In der Psychologie wurde er 1907 von James Rowland Angell in einem Aufsatz über Edward Bradford Titchener eingeführt. In der Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft wurde er seit den 1920er vom Prager linguistischen Kreis verwendet. Dort knüpfte Roman Jakobson an die Schule des Russischen Formalismus an und verwendete den Begriff „Strukturalismus“ erstmals 1929 in einem in der Prager Zeitschrift \"Čin\" auf Tschechisch unter dem Titel \"Romantischer Panslawismus – neue Slawistik\" (\"Romantické všeslovanství — nová slávistika\") veröffentlichten Aufsatz:Were we to comprise the leading idea of present-day science in its most various manifestations, we could hardly find a more appropriate designation than structuralism. Any set of phenomena examined by contemporary science is treated not as a mechanical agglomeration but as a structural whole, and the basic task is to reveal the inner, whether static or developmental, laws of this system. What appears to be the focus of scientific preoccupations is no longer the outer stimulus, but the internal premises of the development; now the mechanical conception of processes yields to the question of their functions.\n",
